### For this project we based our application off of a schema design.

  - Above is the One To Many Relationships I came up with.
  - For my one to many to relationship I chose my Parent to be `Ski_shops` and the Children to be all the possible pieces of `Equipment` that each ski shop could have.
  
  
  - In this project I learned how to: 
    - Create a design for my One to Many Relationship schema.
    - Learned about M.V.C and how to navigate that pattern. 
    - Implement C.R.U.D resources for each page.
    - Write tests for models and features.
    - How to create methods on a model using ActiveRecord.
